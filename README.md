Virtual_Painter_using_OpenCV

"Virtual Painter: A Python application using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, enabling users to draw on a canvas using hand gestures captured by a webcam. Features include real-time color selection, brush thickness adjustment, and eraser functionality. Users can interactively create artwork by moving their hands in the air, with the ability to clear the canvas and select different drawing colors. This project provides a fun and interactive way to explore digital painting using computer vision techniques."
